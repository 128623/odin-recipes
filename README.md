# Odin Recipes Project

## Introduction

Welcome to the Odin Recipes project! In this project, I will create a simple recipe website to practice and demonstrate my web development skills.

## Project Description
The project involves building a recipe website. It consists of a home page containing links to different recipes retrieved from https://www.allrecipes.com/. Each recipe's page includes the necessary ingredients and step-by-step instructions. By completing it, I aim to showcase the following skills:

 - HTML Structure: I will demonstrate my ability to create well-structured HTML documents.

 - Linking Pages: I will practice linking web pages together for easy navigation.

 - Content Presentation: I will practice presenting content effectively, including images, descriptions, ingredient lists, and step-by-step instructions for each recipe.

 - Organizing Content: I will organize the content logically to make it user-friendly and easy to follow
